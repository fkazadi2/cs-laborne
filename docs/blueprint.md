## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5), inspired by a sense of trust, authority and professionalism that such an important institution as the C.S. La Borne should communicate to parents. The hue must be neither so light that it feels childish, nor so dark that it evokes feelings of depression.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#ECEFF1), providing a clean and modern backdrop that doesn't distract from the content. The light scheme reflects the importance of education as enlightenment.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#7E57C2), positioned approximately 30 degrees from the primary blue on the color wheel. It will offer a complementary contrast for interactive elements.
- Clean, sans-serif typography.
- Simple, consistent icons for navigation and key features.
- Clean layout with ample white space.
- Subtle transitions and feedback animations to enhance user experience.
